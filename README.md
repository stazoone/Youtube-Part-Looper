# Youtube-Part-Looper
A script that works on browsers that allows you to loop only a certain part of a youtube video.

To make it work go to your browsers extension menu and try adding a custom/temporary extension. When asked to upload the files you can upload any of the 4 files from the folder.

To use it, you have to be on a youtube tab with a video, press on the extension button, then you can select the time for the start of the loop and the end.
